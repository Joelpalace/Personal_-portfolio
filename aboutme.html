<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Joel Essienobong</h3>
  <p>Hey, my name is Joel, and there's little I find more exciting than solving problems! I've spent most of my young life being amazed by sofisticated concepts. Hence the reason i have chosen a part in programmimg.I'm an individual with a strong passion for technology and innovation. My journey began with a curiosity for how things work, leading me to pursue a career in tech. I  want to thrive in backend engineering, where I get to design and implement robust systems that make a real difference. Outside of work, I love exploring new technologies, learning about different cultures, and engaging in outdoor activities.<br> I am dedicated to continuous learning and personal growth, always eager to take on new challenges and contribute to meaningful projects. I believe in the power of collaboration and creativity to drive positive change in the world.   <br /> <br />
